## UTM Assignment Algorithm & Data Structure
Assignment from UTM. Using linked list and queue, I build a simple application with C++.
If you are a student, don't just copy paste. Improve upon this code. It still has so much room to improve.
If you are my lecturer, I did this!
If you are my employer, I never stop coding.

#### To run this app, simply compile and run with sudent.txt on the same directory level.

#### Things to improve:
1. Better user interface
2. Search function
3. Printable format
4. Demontrate more Queue concept
